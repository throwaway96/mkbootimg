# `mkbootimg`/`unpackbootimg`

Somewhat modern versions of some old Android tools for manipulating `boot.img` files.

## Credits

These tools are originally from the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), which has replaced them with Python scripts.
They were updated and maintained by [`osm0sis`](https://github.com/osm0sis/mkbootimg) until 2022.
I've included a [PR](https://github.com/osm0sis/mkbootimg/pull/18) from [Osvaldo Costa](https://github.com/osvcos).
